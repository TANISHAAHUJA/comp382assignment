# COMP 382 Assignment 1 - Topic 7: DFA Language Reversal

This project demonstrates the proof that for any DFA M, the reverse of strings in L(M), that is (L(M))^R = { w^R | w âˆˆ L(M) }, is regular.

## Project Structure
- `proof.tex` - LaTeX document containing the formal proof
- `presentation.pdf` - Presentation slides
- `examples/` - Example DFAs and their reversed NFAs

## Work Distribution
- Partner 1: Tanisha Ahuja
